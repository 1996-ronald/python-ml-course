# [Complete Machine Learning Course: Data Science in Python] (https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearningpython/)

## Requirements
* High school math or basic statistical knowledge is required
* It is recommended to know how to program a little to focus on learning the analysis techniques in Python although it is not totally necessary
## Description
Do the words Machine Learning or Data Scientist ring a bell? Are you curious about what these techniques are for or why companies around the world pay a data scientist a salary of $ 120,000 to $ 200,000 a year?

Well, this course is thought and designed by a professional in the world of Data Science such as Juan Gabriel Gomila, so that he will share all his knowledge and help you understand the complex theory of mathematics behind it, the algorithms and Programming libraries with Python to become all experts despite having no previous experience.

We will see step by step how to start working with concepts and algorithms from the world of Machine Learning. With each new class and section that you complete you will have new skills that will help you understand this world so complete and lucrative that this branch of Data Science can be.

Also tell you that this course is very fun, along the lines of Juan Gabriel Gomila and that you will learn and have fun while learning about Machine Learning techniques with Python. In particular, the topics that we will work on will be the following:

- Part 1 - Installation of Python and necessary packages for data science, machine learning and data visualization
- Part 2 - Historical evolution of predictive analysis and machine learning
- Part 3 - Pre-processing and data cleaning
- Part 4 - Data management and data wrangling, operations with most famous datasets and probability distributions
- Part 5 - Review of basic statistics, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, correlation, ...
- Part 6 - Simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and polynomial regression, categorical variables and treatment of outliers.
- Part 7 - Classification with logistic regression, estimation with maximum likelihood, cross-validation, K-fold cross validation, ROC curves
- Part 8 - Clustering, K-means, K-medoids, dendrograms and hierarchical clustering, elbow technique and silhouette analysis
- Part 9 - Classification with trees, random forests, pruning techniques, entropy, maximization of information
- Part 10 - Support Vector Machines for classification and regression problems, non-linear kernels, facial recognition (how CSI works)
- Part 11 - The closest K neighbors, majority decision, programming Machine Learning algorithms vs Python libraries
- Part 12 - Principal component analysis, dimension reduction, LDA
- Part 13 - Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial and convolutional neural networks and Tensor Flow

In addition, in the course you will find exercises, datasets to practice based on real life examples, so that you will not only learn the theory with the videos, but also to practice to build your own Machine Learning models. And how can we not forget that you will have a github with all the Python source code to download and use in all your projects. So do not wait any longer and sign up for the most complete and useful Machine Learning course on the Spanish market!
